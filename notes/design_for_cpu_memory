so lets clone that on laptop and confirm it wroks
and then we need to clean it up
using what we know from the memory simulator
and lets do instruction memory on that side
and probably even hook in the memory simualtor?
the statics will be a problem...
cant have more than one memory
need it to be configurable...

do not damage ur laptop..
be careful on stairs man pelase

so we can create a hack memory
or we can configure the current memory to be able to do what we need and be more dynamic
the choice feels pretty obv
dont put in a hack

alright so if we arnt putting in a hack
then how do we dynamically confgiure this memory to work
well we have to bypass the cache entirely
ah shit this sucks
want to hack 

so much code to write damnit
not even sure how this is gonna get done
because if we hack then we are doing unnceccesary work
and if we dont it takes a while

so what do we need
we need to make the vpi for instruction memory and data memory
no cycle delay
but 2 separate memories

so i guess we need inits
that will instantiate instruction memory and data memroy
can just use and integer id or something 0, 1
then u need to maek the memroy allocation dynmaic
cant be too bad
yah we can do that
shitty part is each one needs its own cache and memory
sigh

next question is
how do we configure it for 0 delay.
need to bypass cahce entirely
and get rid of cache lines and stuff
sigh 
so we probably need to add functions
and add delay params in the memory object
yup
okay cool design is coming along
